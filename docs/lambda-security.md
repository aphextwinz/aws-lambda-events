## Event Sources

### Synch flow (API GW, AppSync)

- Event source can authorize requests (cognito or oidc or jwt or custom or ssl client auth)
- Event source can be linked to a waf (AWS Shield, AWS WAF) or cdn (CloudFront)
- Event source can add usage limits and throttling per api client per endpoint
- Event source can include request validation
- Event source can be within a [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-apis.html)
- Event source can limit sourceIp or VPC [Controlling access to an API with API Gateway resource policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-resource-policies.html)

```

### Asynch flow (S3, EventBridge)

- Event source can do batching
- Event source can have filtering

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client --> id1(Event Source) --> id5(Requests) <--> id2(Lambda Service) <--> id3(Lambda Function) <--> id4(Down Stream)
```

### Asynch flow (Dynamodb)

- Updates can be filtered
- Updates can be sent to EventBridge to further filtering

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client --> id1(Event Source) --> id5(Changes) <--> id2(Lambda Service) <--> id3(Lambda Function) <--> id4(Down Stream)
```

## Ideas to be documented

- [Data protection in AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/security-dataprotection.html){target="_blank"}
    - `Encryption in transit` - Lambda API endpoints only support secure connections over HTTPS.
    - `Encryption at rest` - On a per-function basis, you can configure Lambda to use a [customer managed key to encrypt your environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption){target="_blank"}. Conterary to the AWS docs, i would not recommended using environments variables for secrets, but rather secret manager (or parameter store).
    Lambda always encrypts files that you upload to Lambda, including deployment packages and layer archives. Amazon CloudWatch Logs and AWS X-Ray also encrypt data by default.
